I was assigned to design and implement a Gifs SPA application for searching and sharing funny gifs with your friends. The application should be able to display the top trending gifs, upload gifs and much more! For our purposes we are going to use the Giphy API.

# Functionalities:

1. **Display Trending Gifs**

The application has a display trending gifs functionality, that allows the user to see the top trending gifs. I used the trending endpoint.

2. **Search Gifs**

The application has a search gifs functionality, that allows the user to search gifs by a given query. I used the search endpoint and a search query – q, provided by the user.

3. **Display Gif Details**

The application has a display gif details functionality, that allows the user to see a given gif’s detailed information like uploaded user’s username. I used the get-gif-by-id endpoint.

4. **Upload a Gif**

The application has an upload gif functionality, that allows the user to upload a gif from his file system. I used the upload endpoint with POST request. After the upload, you can see the uploaded gif in your Giphy Channel.


5. **Display Uploaded Gifs**

The application has a display uploaded gifs functionality, that allows the user to see his uploaded gifs.

6. **Favorite a Gif**

The application has a favorite gif functionality, that allows the user to make a gif his favorite. If the user hasn’t chosen a favorite gif yet, he is notified, and a random gif will be shown as a favorite.

# General Requirements

- I had to use jQuery for DOM manipulations.

- I had to use ESLint to write consistently styled code.

- I had to use modules and they should be single-responsible.

- I had to document my code explicitly following the JSDoc standard.

- I had to use correct naming and write clean, self-documenting code.

- I had to have an usable user interface.

- I had to use the latest features of ECMAScript.
